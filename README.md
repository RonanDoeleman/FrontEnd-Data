# FrontEnd-Data
This is my repository for the Information Design: tech track, for the study Communication and Multimedia Design at the HvA.

# What did we do at FrontEnd-Data?
The goal was to create a data visualisation (using the d3 library) based on given data where data can be explored through interaction using enter(), update(), and exit(). In the first week we had to try out animations with svg. We used keyframes to manipulate the svg. The next goal was to create a interactive visualisation with data either from an api or the survey we had to fill out for functional programming.

# Rubric
